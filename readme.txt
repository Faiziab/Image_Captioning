# Visualizing the Unseen: Enhancing Image Accessibility through Image Captioning

Welcome to the "Visualizing the Unseen" project! üì∏üîç

This repository houses the code and resources for our innovative project aimed at enhancing image accessibility through advanced image captioning techniques. By providing descriptive captions for images, we empower visually impaired individuals to perceive and engage with visual content in a more meaningful way.

## Features

- **Image Captioning Model**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models to generate descriptive captions for images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive user interface for uploading images and receiving generated captions.
- **Customization**: Fine-tune the captioning model for specific domains or languages.
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Supports both image upload and URL input for enhanced flexibility.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the "Visualizing the Unseen" project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/visualizing-the-unseen.git`.

2. **Setup Environment**: Set up your Python environment with the required dependencies. You can use `requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Download Pre-trained Model**: Download the pre-trained image captioning model weights from [here](model_weights_link) and place them in the `models/` directory.

4. **Run the Application**: Launch the image captioning application by running `python app.py`. This will start a local web server.

5. **Access the Interface**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the image captioning interface.

## Project Structure

The "Visualizing the Unseen" project is organized as follows:

- `app.py`: The main script that sets up the web application and handles user interactions.
- `image_captioning.py`: Contains the code for image caption generation using the pre-trained model.
- `models/`: Directory for storing pre-trained model weights.
- `templates/` and `static/`: Directories containing HTML templates and static assets for the web interface.
- `data/`: Placeholder for additional data or resources needed for the project.
- `docs/`: Documentation files, including user guides and references.
